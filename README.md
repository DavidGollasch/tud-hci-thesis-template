## How to Use
1. Download or fork this project

	- Get an overview of what's in the package
4. Pay attention on compiling instructions to avoid errors

## Custom Fonts
This template comprises a set of custom fonts enabled by default. If you prefer LaTeX's default Latin Modern font family, open the _includes/commands.tex_ file and remove the section below the _Custom Fonts_ comment including the _linespread_ command as well as the three _set****font_ commands.
